# Tiktok Trimmer

Sometimes, you want to share a TikTok with someone, but you don't want the Tiktok outro tag to distract them at the end of the video. 
This website trims the tag off your videos with ffmpeg.wasm. It's built with Preact and Vite. Through the power of WebAssembly, all the processing happens right in your browser, so I don't have to pay server costs.

## Getting Started

-   `npm run dev` - Starts a dev server at http://localhost:5173/

-   `npm run build` - Builds for production, emitting to `dist/`

-   `npm run preview` - Starts a server at http://localhost:4173/ to test production build locally
